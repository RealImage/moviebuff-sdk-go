Go SDK for [Moviebuff](www.moviebuff.com)

The Moviebuff is a service that offers information about
 movies, people and entities.

All resources are identified by a UUID,
which Moviebuff.com uniquely and randomly generates.
Since it may be difficult to get the Moviebuff UUID of
 any resource without prior knowledge, the API also
 allows substitution of the UUID with the URL
 identifier of the resource. For instance, if when
 attempting to get information for 12 Years a Slave
  (moviebuff.com/12-years-a-slave), either its UUID
  or the identifier 12-years-a-slave may be used.

Sample usage:

    movie, err := new(moviego.Moviebuff).Init(os.Getenv("API_TOKEN"), nil).GetMovie("padmaavat")
    if err!=nil{
        return err
    }

    log.Println("Padmaavat was release in year ", movie.GetEarliestReleaseYear())
